bio: im a newbie with hacking consoles, a newbie coder. i am a transgender woman (of course i was gonna end up doing com sci at some point lol) With hacking consoles, i currently mainly hack nintedo consoles as those are consoles i have. i have hacked a nintedo switch, a wii, and a 3ds So far, i plan later on hacking a ps3, wii u, and other types of consoles at somepoint in the future. i am a massive advocat that people modify their consoles and defy companies, consoles like the nintedo switch dont have any personallity, while old consoles used to, i take that as a call to action that we need to modfiy the consoles ourselves and give our own consoles personallity.
